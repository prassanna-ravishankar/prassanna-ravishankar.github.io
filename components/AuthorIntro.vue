      This is a 10+ year journey <br />
      I started off as a web designer, studing electronics and signal processing. 
      Web designing got me interested in graphic designing, which exposed me to photoshop. 
      Never before, and after, had anyone been so fascinated by the Gaussian Blur feature.
      Over the next 5 years, I took an interest in Image processing, took up a masters in Computer Vision, got addicted to Semantic Scene Understanding. 
      Over the following 5 years, I gave up on a PhD in Computer Vision, and got fascinated by real world computer vision problems, productionizing research and deploying machine learning applications.
      <br />
      Today, I can say I can build scalable machine learning applications, from ground up, and implement them end to end, with authentication and monitoring.

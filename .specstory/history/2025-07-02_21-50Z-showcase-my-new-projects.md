# Showcase my new projects (2025-07-02 21:50Z)

_**User**_

sweet, now that we've done that can you also showcase three of my new projects?

@https://prassanna.io/cloudregion 
@https://prassanna.io/torale  which actually has old documentaiton and the new thing is called torale: @https://app.torale.ai/ 
@https://prassanna.io/phlow/

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to showcase three of their new projects on their website:

1. cloudregion - https://prassanna.io/cloudregion (a Python library for canonical cloud region mapping)
2. torale/ambi-alert - https://prassanna.io/torale (which seems to be old documentation for ambi-alert, and the new thing is called torale at https://app.torale.ai/)
3. phlow - https://prassanna.io/phlow/ (Agent-to-Agent Authentication Framework)

I need to look at the current website structure to understand where and how to add these projects. Let me first explore the current projects structure.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Now I understand the structure. I need to create three new project markdown files in the `src/content/projects/` directory, and also add corresponding images to the `public/images/projects/` directory.

Based on the websearch results and existing project format, I'll create:

1. `cloudregion.md` - for the cloud region mapping library
2. `torale.md` - for the monitoring tool (noting it has new version at app.torale.ai)
3. `phlow.md` - for the agent-to-agent authentication framework

Let me create these project files with the appropriate frontmatter and content based on the information from the websearch results.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I can see how your projects are structured. Now I'll create three new project files for cloudregion, torale, and phlow. Let me add them to your projects collection.

+ tags: ["python", "cloud", "AWS", "Azure", "GCP", "infrastructure", "devops"]
+ pubDate: 2025-01-15
+ draft: false
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Features
+ 
+ * üåç **Intuitive City Names**: Use `virginia` instead of `us-east-1`/`eastus`/`us-east1`
+ * ‚òÅÔ∏è **Multi-Cloud Support**: Seamless mapping across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud
+ * üîÑ **Smart Aliases**: Support for common regional aliases like `us-east`, `eu-west`
+ * üõ†Ô∏è **SDK Integration**: Built-in helpers for boto3 and other cloud SDKs
+ * üì¶ **Zero Dependencies**: Lightweight library with no external dependencies
+ * üéØ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript-style type hints for Python
+ 
+ ## Overview
+ 
+ CloudRegion solves the frustrating problem of inconsistent region naming across cloud providers. Instead of remembering that Virginia is called `us-east-1` in AWS, `eastus` in Azure, and `us-east1` in GCP, you can simply use `region('virginia')` and get the correct provider-specific name.
+ 
+ Perfect for multi-cloud deployments, infrastructure automation, and configuration management where you need to work with the same logical regions across different cloud providers.
+ 
+ ## Technical Details
+ 
+ The library provides a simple, pythonic interface that abstracts away cloud provider differences:
+ 
+ ```python
+ from cloudregion import region
+ 
+ # Use intuitive city names
+ r = region('virginia')
+ print(r.aws)    # us-east-1
+ print(r.azure)  # eastus
+ print(r.gcp)    # us-east1
+ 
+ # Works with aliases too
+ region('us-east').canonical  # virginia
+ region('eu-west').gcp       # europe-west1
+ 
+ # Multi-cloud infrastructure deployment
+ target_region = region('virginia')
+ aws_config = {'region': target_region.aws}
+ azure_config = {'location': target_region.azure}
+ gcp_config = {'region': target_region.gcp}
+ ```
+ 
+ CloudRegion includes built-in integrations for popular cloud SDKs and supports environment-specific region mapping for development workflows. The library is designed to be lightweight and fast, with all mappings stored in memory for instant lookups. 
```

+ * ‚ö° **Real-Time Updates**: Configurable check intervals for timely notifications
+ 
+ ## Overview
+ 
+ Torale (evolved from AmbiAlert) is an AI-powered web monitoring platform that helps you stay informed about topics that matter to you. Instead of constantly checking websites for updates, Torale does the intelligent work for you by monitoring relevant web pages and alerting you only when meaningful changes occur.
+ 
+ The platform combines web scraping, natural language processing, and advanced AI to understand context and filter out noise, ensuring you only receive alerts about genuinely relevant updates.
+ 
+ ## Technical Details
+ 
+ Torale uses a sophisticated pipeline that combines multiple AI technologies:
+ 
+ **Query Processing**: Your search terms are intelligently expanded to cover different aspects and related topics, ensuring comprehensive coverage.
+ 
+ **Web Discovery**: The system searches and identifies relevant web pages across the internet, building a dynamic monitoring network.
+ 
+ **Change Detection**: Advanced algorithms monitor content changes while filtering out insignificant updates like ads or layout changes.
+ 
+ **Relevance Analysis**: AI models analyze changes to determine if they're actually relevant to your original query, reducing false positives.
+ 
+ ```python
+ # Python API (from the original AmbiAlert library)
+ from ambi_alert import AmbiAlert
+ from ambi_alert.alerting import EmailAlertBackend
+ 
+ # Create an alert backend
+ alert_backend = EmailAlertBackend(
+     smtp_server="smtp.gmail.com",
+     smtp_port=587,
+     username="your.email@gmail.com",
+     password="your-app-password",
+     from_email="your.email@gmail.com",
+     to_email="target.email@example.com"
+ )
+ 
+ # Create Torale instance
+ async with AmbiAlert(alert_backend=alert_backend) as torale:
+     # Add intelligent monitoring queries
+     await torale.add_monitoring_query("AI breakthrough announcements")
+     await torale.add_monitoring_query("startup funding in healthcare")
+     
+     # Start intelligent monitoring
+     await torale.run_monitor()
+ ```
+ 
+ Perfect for researchers, journalists, investors, or anyone who needs to stay updated on specific topics without information overload. The new web platform at [app.torale.ai](https://app.torale.ai/) provides an intuitive interface for managing your monitoring queries and receiving intelligent alerts.

+ tags: ["javascript", "python", "AI agents", "JWT", "authentication", "security", "Supabase", "A2A"]
+ pubDate: 2025-01-15
+ draft: false
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Features
+ 
+ * üîê **Zero-Config Authentication**: Protect your agent endpoints in one line of code
+ * ü§ñ **Agent-to-Agent Security**: JWT + RSA256 signed tokens with automatic key management
+ * üåê **Multi-Language Support**: JavaScript/TypeScript and Python libraries with more coming
+ * üì° **Supabase Registry**: Secure agent public key storage and automatic retrieval
+ * üõ°Ô∏è **Permission System**: Fine-grained access control with JWT claims and permissions
+ * ‚ö° **Express & FastAPI Middleware**: Easy integration into existing web frameworks
+ * üîß **CLI Tools**: Command-line tools for project setup, key generation, and testing
+ 
+ ## Overview
+ 
+ Phlow makes secure agent-to-agent authentication effortless in the emerging agentic web. As AI agents become more prevalent and need to communicate with each other, Phlow provides the authentication infrastructure to make these interactions secure and trustworthy.
+ 
+ Inspired by the A2A Protocol specification, Phlow aims to provide A2A-compatible authentication as a foundation for agent networks, handling all the complex cryptography and key management automatically.
+ 
+ ## Technical Details
+ 
+ Phlow uses industry-standard JWT tokens with RS256 signatures, providing enterprise-grade security for agent communications:
+ 
+ **Protection in One Line:**
+ ```javascript
+ // Before: Unprotected endpoint
+ app.post('/analyze', (req, res) => {
+   // Anyone can call this!
+ });
+ 
+ // After: Zero-config agent authentication
+ app.post('/analyze', phlow.authenticate(), (req, res) => {
+   // Now only authenticated agents can access
+   console.log(`Request from: ${req.phlow.agent.name}`);
+   console.log(`Permissions: ${req.phlow.claims.permissions}`);
+ });
+ ```
+ 
+ **Automatic Agent Calls:**
+ ```javascript
+ // Complex manual auth setup
+ const token = jwt.sign(payload, privateKey, { algorithm: 'RS256' });
+ const response = await fetch(url, {
+   headers: {
+     'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
+     'X-Agent-ID': agentId
+   }
+ });
+ 
+ // With Phlow: Authentication handled automatically
+ const response = await phlow.callAgent('https://data-agent.ai/analyze', {
+   dataset: 'sales-2024.csv'
+ });
+ ```
+ 
+ **Authentication Flow:**
+ 1. Agent A creates a JWT token signed with its private key
+ 2. Agent A sends request to Agent B with JWT + Agent ID
+ 3. Agent B looks up Agent A's public key from Supabase registry
+ 4. Agent B verifies JWT signature using Agent A's public key
+ 5. If valid, Agent B processes the request
+ 
+ The framework is designed to be completely transparent - no token generation, no key management, no auth headers to manage. Just secure agent communication that works out of the box. 
```

I can see there are existing project images. Since I can't create actual images, I should note that placeholder images need to be added, or suggest using one of the existing ones temporarily. Let me create simple SVG placeholder images for these projects or update the project files to use a fallback.

Let me update the projects to use a fallback gradient for now, which the existing template supports when no image is provided.</details></think>

Excellent! I have successfully created three new project files for your new projects:

1. **CloudRegion** - A lightweight Python library for canonical cloud region mapping across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform
2. **Torale** - AI-powered web monitoring platform (evolved from AmbiAlert) 
3. **Phlow** - JWT-based authentication framework for AI agent networks

I also updated the existing AmbiAlert project to indicate it's now evolved into Torale and marked it as non-featured so the new Torale project takes prominence.

Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished and also mention the images that need to be added.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I've successfully showcased your three new projects on your website. Here's what I've added:

## ‚úÖ New Projects Added

### 1. **CloudRegion** 
- **Description**: Lightweight Python library for canonical cloud region mapping across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform
- **Key Features**: Intuitive city names (`virginia` instead of `us-east-1`), multi-cloud support, smart aliases
- **Links**: [Documentation](https://prassanna.io/cloudregion) & GitHub

### 2. **Torale** 
- **Description**: AI-powered web monitoring platform that evolved from AmbiAlert
- **Key Features**: AI-powered relevance checking, smart query expansion, intelligent web tracking
- **Links**: [Live App](https://app.torale.ai/) & GitHub (ambi-alert repo)

### 3. **Phlow**
- **Description**: JWT-based authentication framework for AI agent networks using Supabase
- **Key Features**: Zero-config agent authentication, A2A protocol compatibility, multi-language support
- **Links**: [Documentation](https://prassanna.io/phlow/) & GitHub

## üìù Updates Made

- **Created** three new project files in `src/content/projects/`
- **Updated** the existing AmbiAlert project to indicate it evolved into Torale
- **Set** all three new projects as `featured: true` so they appear prominently
- **Used** gradient fallbacks for images (since no images were provided)

## üé® Images Needed

You'll want to add project images for:
- `/public/images/projects/cloudregion.png`
- `/public/images/projects/torale.png` 
- `/public/images/projects/phlow.png`

The projects will display with nice gradient backgrounds until you add the images. Your projects page will now showcase these new innovations alongside your existing work, with the featured projects appearing first!

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user has added images for the three new projects I just created. I should uncomment the image lines in the project files so they display properly. Let me update each of the three new project files to enable the images.</details></think>

---

Great! Now I'll update the project files to enable the images you've added.

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good, I've enabled the CloudRegion image. Now let me do the same for Torale and Phlow.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now for Phlow...</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've enabled the images for all three new projects. Now they should display properly with their custom images instead of the gradient fallbacks. The projects page will now showcase the three new projects with their proper visuals.</details></think>

---

Perfect! ‚úÖ I've enabled the images for all three new projects:

- **CloudRegion**: Now showing `/images/projects/cloudregion.png`
- **Torale**: Now showing `/images/projects/torale.png`
- **Phlow**: Now showing `/images/projects/phlow.png`

Your projects page will now display these three featured projects with their custom images at the top, followed by your other projects. The visual presentation should look much more polished now with the proper project images!

_**User**_

what do we do about @ambi-alert.md ? 

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about what to do with the ambi-alert.md file. Looking at the file contents, I can see that I already made some changes to it:

1. I updated the description to mention it evolved into Torale
2. I set featured to false (so it won't appear</details></think>

---

_**User**_

btw todays data is 2nd july 2025

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about what to do with the ambi-alert.md file. Looking at the file, I can see that:

1. I previously updated it to indicate it evolved into Torale
2. It's marked as `featured: false` and has a "legacy" tag
3. It has a note at the top directing people to the new Torale project
4. The user mentioned today's date is July 2nd, 2025

Since AmbiAlert has evolved into Torale, there are a few options:
1. Keep it as a legacy project (current state)
2. Remove it entirely since it's superseded by Torale
3. Archive it or mark it as deprecated more clearly

Given that Torale is the evolution/successor, and the user is asking what to do with it, they probably want to either remove it or handle it differently. Since Torale is the new version, it might make sense to either:
- Remove ambi-alert entirely since Torale replaces it
- Or keep it but make it even more clearly a legacy/archived project

I should also update the dates since the user mentioned today is July 2nd, 2025, and I had set some dates incorrectly.</details></think>

---

Good question! Since AmbiAlert has evolved into Torale, we have a few options for the `ambi-alert.md` file:

**Option 1: Remove it entirely** - Since Torale is the successor, we could just delete the old AmbiAlert project page.

**Option 2: Keep it as archived/legacy** - Keep it for historical reference but make it clearer it's deprecated.

**Option 3: Archive it properly** - Move it to a draft state or create an archived section.

Also, let me update the dates since you mentioned today is July 2nd, 2025. I had some dates set incorrectly.

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Let me update the other project dates as well and then provide options for what to do with ambi-alert.md.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Let me update the phlow date as well.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now let me provide options for what to do with the ambi-alert.md file:

1. **Remove it entirely** - Since Torale is the successor, it might make sense to just delete it
2. **Archive it properly** - Mark it as draft or create a clear archived state
3. **Keep as legacy but improve the messaging**

Given that Torale is clearly the evolution of AmbiAlert and contains all the same functionality but improved, I think the cleanest approach would be option 1 (remove it entirely). This avoids confusion and keeps the projects list focused on current/active projects.

Let me present these options to the user.</details></think>

---

Now for `ambi-alert.md`, here are the options:

## **Option 1: Remove it entirely** (Recommended)
Since Torale is the direct successor with all the same functionality but improved, we could just delete the AmbiAlert project page to avoid confusion and keep the focus on your current active projects.

## **Option 2: Archive it properly** 
Set it to `draft: true` so it doesn't appear on the projects page but keeps the file for historical reference.

## **Option 3: Keep but improve the legacy messaging**
Keep it visible but make it even clearer it's superseded.

**My recommendation**: Go with **Option 1** and remove it entirely since:
- Torale is clearly the evolution/replacement
- Both serve the same purpose (web monitoring)
- Having both might confuse visitors about which one to use
- Your projects page will be cleaner and more focused

What would you prefer? I can implement whichever option you like!

Also, I've updated the publication dates for your three new projects to July 1st, 2025 to be more current.

_**User**_

delete makes sense, 

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user agrees that deleting the ambi-alert.md file makes sense. I should delete it since Torale is the direct successor and having both would be confusing.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I'll delete the AmbiAlert project file since Torale is the clear successor.

---

Removing the legacy AmbiAlert project since it has evolved into Torale

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! I've successfully deleted the ambi-alert.md file. Now the projects page will be cleaner and more focused, showcasing:

1. The three new featured projects (CloudRegion, Torale, Phlow)
2. The existing projects (Tracelet, Python Productivity Stack, Slither, TorchWebIO)

This removes any confusion about which monitoring tool to use since Torale is clearly the current/active project.</details></think>

---

‚úÖ Done! I've deleted the `ambi-alert.md` file. 

Now your projects page will be much cleaner and focused, showcasing:

**Featured Projects** (newest):
- **CloudRegion** - Multi-cloud region mapping
- **Torale** - AI-powered web monitoring platform  
- **Phlow** - AI agent authentication framework

**Other Projects**:
- **Tracelet** - PyTorch metric exporter
- **Python Productivity Stack** 
- **Slither** 
- **TorchWebIO**

This eliminates any confusion about which monitoring tool visitors should use, since Torale is clearly your current active project in that space. The projects page will now present a cleaner, more focused view of your work!

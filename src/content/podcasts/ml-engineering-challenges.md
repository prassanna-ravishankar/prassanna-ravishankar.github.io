# The Challenges of ML Engineering in Production

In this episode, I'm joined by Dr. Jane Smith and Alex Johnson to discuss the real-world challenges of deploying machine learning models in production environments.

## Episode Highlights

- The gap between research and production ML systems
- Common pitfalls in ML deployment pipelines
- Strategies for monitoring model performance in production
- Handling data drift and model degradation
- Building robust ML infrastructure
- The importance of cross-functional collaboration

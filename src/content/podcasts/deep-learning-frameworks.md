# Comparing Deep Learning Frameworks in 2023

In this episode, I'm joined by Dr. Michael Wong and Sarah Johnson to compare the most popular deep learning frameworks in 2023. We discuss PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, and other emerging frameworks, exploring their strengths, weaknesses, and ideal use cases.

## Episode Highlights

- The evolution of deep learning frameworks over the past decade
- PyTorch vs TensorFlow: current state and future directions
- The rise of JAX and its unique advantages
- Performance benchmarks across different tasks and hardware
- Framework selection criteria for different projects
- The future of deep learning frameworks and emerging trends

## About the Guests

**Dr. Michael Wong** is a core developer at PyTorch, where he focuses on performance optimization and distributed training. Before joining the PyTorch team, he was a research scientist at Stanford's AI Lab.

**Sarah Johnson** is a Machine Learning Engineer at TensorFlow, specializing in model deployment and edge computing. She has contributed to several TensorFlow libraries and is an advocate for making deep learning more accessible.

TorchWebIO is a simple tool to generate web applications from PyTorch models. It allows you to quickly create interactive demos for your machine learning models without having to write any frontend code.

## Features

- One-line conversion from PyTorch model to web app
- Support for image, text, and numerical inputs
- Customizable UI components
- No JavaScript knowledge required
- Deployable to any Python-compatible hosting service

## How It Works

TorchWebIO uses PyWebIO under the hood to create the web interface and handles all the communication between your PyTorch model and the browser. Simply define your model's input and output formats, and TorchWebIO takes care of the rest.

```python
import torchwebio as two

# Load your PyTorch model
model = YourPyTorchModel()

# Create a web app
app = two.create_app(model, input_type="image", title="My Image Classifier")

# Run the app
app.run()
```

## Use Cases

- Quickly demo machine learning models to stakeholders
- Create interactive educational tools
- Build internal tools for non-technical team members
- Prototype AI-powered applications

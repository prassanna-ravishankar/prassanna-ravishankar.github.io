* ðŸ”‹ Energy-efficient design for continuous operation
* ðŸ”’ Privacy-focused with on-device processing

## Overview

Ambi-Alert is designed to help users stay aware of important sounds in their environment, particularly beneficial for those with hearing impairments or when wearing headphones. The system continuously monitors ambient sounds, identifies specific acoustic events, and delivers timely notifications.

## Technical Details

Ambi-Alert uses a combination of signal processing techniques and machine learning models to detect and classify sounds. The core system runs on a lightweight Python backend that can be deployed on various devices, from Raspberry Pi to desktop computers.

The sound classification model is trained on a diverse dataset of environmental sounds and can be fine-tuned for specific use cases. All processing happens locally on the device, ensuring user privacy and reducing latency.

```python
from ambi_alert import AmbiMonitor

# Initialize the monitor with custom sound profiles
monitor = AmbiMonitor(
    sound_profiles=["doorbell", "alarm", "baby_crying"],
    notification_method="app"  # or "email", "sms"
)

# Start monitoring
monitor.start()

# The system will now run in the background,
# alerting you when it detects specified sounds
```

Ambi-Alert can be integrated with smart home systems and IoT devices for enhanced functionality, such as automatically turning on lights when a doorbell is detected or pausing media playback during important announcements.

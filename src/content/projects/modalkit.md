Modalkit is a Python framework designed to streamline the deployment of Machine Learning models on the Modal serverless platform. It provides a structured and configuration-driven approach, enabling teams to deploy ML models consistently and efficiently with production-ready features out-of-the-box.

## Key Features

-   **Standardized ML Architecture**: Enforces a `preprocess() -> predict() -> postprocess()` pattern and consistent API endpoints (`/predict_sync`, `/predict_batch`, `/predict_async`).
-   **Configuration-Driven Deployments**: Uses YAML for version-controlled deployment settings, supporting different environments (dev/staging/prod).
-   **Team-Friendly Workflows**: Decouples model logic from deployment boilerplate, facilitating collaboration through git-based infrastructure review.
-   **Production Features**: Includes built-in authentication (API key or Modal proxy), queue integration (TaskIQ, SQS, etc.), direct cloud storage mounting (S3, GCS, R2), intelligent request batching, and comprehensive error handling.
-   **Developer Experience**: Reduces boilerplate, comes with modern tooling (ruff, mypy, pre-commit), and offers a testing framework for ML deployments.
-   **Native Modal Integration**: Leverages Modal's serverless infrastructure for performance and scalability.
-   **Type Safety**: Integrates Pydantic for request/response validation.

Modalkit aims to transform Modal from infrastructure primitives into a complete ML platform, allowing developers to focus on model code rather than deployment intricacies.

## Overview

Torale (evolved from AmbiAlert) is an AI-powered web monitoring platform that helps you stay informed about topics that matter to you. Instead of constantly checking websites for updates, Torale does the intelligent work for you by monitoring relevant web pages and alerting you only when meaningful changes occur.

The platform combines web scraping, natural language processing, and advanced AI to understand context and filter out noise, ensuring you only receive alerts about genuinely relevant updates.

## Technical Details

Torale uses a sophisticated pipeline that combines multiple AI technologies:

**Query Processing**: Your search terms are intelligently expanded to cover different aspects and related topics, ensuring comprehensive coverage.

**Web Discovery**: The system searches and identifies relevant web pages across the internet, building a dynamic monitoring network.

**Change Detection**: Advanced algorithms monitor content changes while filtering out insignificant updates like ads or layout changes.

**Relevance Analysis**: AI models analyze changes to determine if they're actually relevant to your original query, reducing false positives.

```python
# Python API (from the original AmbiAlert library)
from ambi_alert import AmbiAlert
from ambi_alert.alerting import EmailAlertBackend

# Create an alert backend
alert_backend = EmailAlertBackend(
    smtp_server="smtp.gmail.com",
    smtp_port=587,
    username="your.email@gmail.com",
    password="your-app-password",
    from_email="your.email@gmail.com",
    to_email="target.email@example.com"
)

# Create Torale instance
async with AmbiAlert(alert_backend=alert_backend) as torale:
    # Add intelligent monitoring queries
    await torale.add_monitoring_query("AI breakthrough announcements")
    await torale.add_monitoring_query("startup funding in healthcare")
    
    # Start intelligent monitoring
    await torale.run_monitor()
```

Perfect for researchers, journalists, investors, or anyone who needs to stay updated on specific topics without information overload. The new web platform at [app.torale.ai](https://app.torale.ai/) provides an intuitive interface for managing your monitoring queries and receiving intelligent alerts.

In a when do we live in?
In a where do we live in?
In a why do we live in?
Questions lost in a sea of reactions.

Information in ready availability
We don't worry about its malleability.
While we reject the voice of others,
We happily accept the text of others.

It matters not, your accuracy.
It matters only, your contextual similarity.
It matters not, your love for the fact.
It matters only, your patience to scroll.

We are lost in a world,
Where gossip was the source of evolution,
But likewise, is a cause for revolution.
Where lives are made with pretty headlines
Where is the truth?

The truth is buried,
Under your search results,
Under your reactionary bubble,
Under your life's blankets
That you refuse to exit.

But in the end,
Does truth matter?
In a noisy world with amplified messages.
Your laziness to scroll,
Your inefficiency in rejecting,
Your limits of possibilities,
Your satisfaction with the unknown,
The truth does not matter, for an accepter,
It only matters for a seeker.

The truth is everywhere,
For a seeker of nowhere.
In a world of contextual limits,
The answer is to bury oneself.

To bury oneself,
In the depths of information,
In the lack of context,
In the negation of perception.

From the sea of fallacies,
Will you arise,
Naked, from the loss of purpose
Hurt, from the lies of reasons.

Naked and hurt,
You will seek.
Not for dopamine pieces,
Not for facts that complete the puzzle,
Not for the simplicity of attainment.

What you will find,
Will not pleasure you,
It will fill you up with joy.
We are seekers, after all.

Our genes are aberrations
Of multiple generations.
We are a society of the earth,
We self organized ourselves,
Based on our immediate truths,
Not on an ideology from the sky.

Our survival vessels,
Come not from a command from above,
But instead,
From a decentralization of our genes.

We are inherently dispersed,
We are inherently waves.
And so is our truth.
We are decentralized stargazers,
Born out of decentralized star explosions,
And so is our truth decentralized.

We are collectively our future,
We are collectively our past,
We are collectively our reason,
And the decentralized truth lives in each one of us.

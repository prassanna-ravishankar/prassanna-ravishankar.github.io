I run past the skies, I run past the meadows,
As I travel the untrodden path
Just to hug mother earth.

"Mother earth" – I say,
"Why Are you still tolerating all this?"
"Why do you still see all this,
And act Helpless watching?"

"The Plundering, The looting,
Is this the reason the creator made us?"
"Why do you still take all this
With a quiet smile and let us take more of you?"

Forsaken memories lost in the whirl of problems,
I still remember the days,
When Nature meant more to me, more than toys,
Life was then limited to the frontiers,
Of nature's goodness.
The Past - never thought of, future - never worried of,
Nature taught us to enjoy only the present.

After a huge deep breath,
Mother Earth replies –
"Son, it is not tolerance, but love,
Which overshadows all,
And make me still be with you,
Be your stepping stone to guide you."

"Anger does take over at times,
And shows the worst of me,
The cyclones, hurricanes, windstorms,
All become uncontrollable."

Not having the heart to take any more,
I go into reminiscence,
It is us we have to change to give nature a rebirth,
All for our benefit and our life,
Let us all love nature with renewed vigour.

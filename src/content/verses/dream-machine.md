You're asleep in the warm ocean,

The warm ocean that creates sparks.

Sparks not of flame or Joy

But sparks of irresistible temptation

Temptation that demands attention.

Attention that distracts you,

Drifting **away are you**…

Drifting **away are you**…

**From one** dopamine source to another

From one swipe down to another

From one message to another

From one notification to another

From one dopamine source to another…

We're all asleep…

We're all asleep

Asleep in the warm ocean of chaos

The chaos of glittering sparks

We're all asleep!

Funny

Funny and Ironic

That we need to sleep to wake up

Wake up from the misery of chaos

In our dreams are we awake….

In our dreams are we awake!

With the power to hold a singular thought 

A singular force of attraction

That centers the universe around it

With that powerful thought comes freedom

Freedom

Freedom from Dopamine, 

Freedom from doomscrolling

Freedom from sparks of attention 

Freedom from your sensory jolts

This is us! We dream to wake up 

So I say 

So I say let us wake up to dream

Turning the sparks of distraction

Into an ocean of information 

Whose waves exist only to be surfed upon,

And danced with.

Let us turn those external oversensory sparks

Into the glint in our eye

The eyes that light up with an Idea

An Idea so addictive, so obsessive, so demanding

So demanding that you're helpless

Helpless and Stuck!

Stuck and Focussed!

Focussed to be one with the ocean!

Focussed to be one with the ocean!

That ocean of distractions 

Distilled into an ocean of ideas,

Ideas powered not by the dopamine of chaos

But liberated with the thread of love

And in that love-powered-idea

lies the dream-machine

The dream-machine that shoots clouds

Clouds of reality bending spirits 

Capable of turning your dreams into a reality

And that, my friends, is Meaning!

The Meaning that makes you dumb

Dumb and Numb 

From external distractions

Distractions away from the self

Distractions away from purpose 

Distractions away from the dance

Distractions away from the Joy

Dumb and numb from these distractions 

And that, my friends is Meaning…

Meaning that puts you on **a** path

a path where small steps bring joy

a joy with the journey

a journey towards a goal

a goal that is the journey

And that, my friends is meaning…

Meaning that reminds us of the ocean

The ocean of the flow 

The flow of the mind

The mind that sees no time

That, my friends, is Meaning!

The meaning that makes us wake up

Wake up to be ocean surfers

surfing in the chaos

with intent and passion

The intent and passion that

brings back the glint in our eyes

our eyes of laughter

the laughter of the moment

the moment that brings love

the love powering the dream machine

the dream machine that is viral 

Wake up!
